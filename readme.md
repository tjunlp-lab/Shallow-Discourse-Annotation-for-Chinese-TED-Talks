In this repository, we provide:

- Datasets for "Shallow Discourse Annotation for Chinese TED Talks" Accepted by LREC 2020: it includes annotation for 16 TED Talks. The resource is currently unique in annotating discourse-level properties of planned spoken monologues rather than of written text. An inter-annotator agreement study demonstrates that the annotation scheme is able to achieve highly reliable results.

- A Chinese tutorial: the Chinese tutorial is beneficial for those who would like to carry out Chinese annotation for discourse annotation with PDTB style, but which still needs to be improved. Your suggestions or ideas towards it are appreciated. 

If you use this dataset in your work, please cite the corresponding paper.

The current work contributes a new resource for Chinese Language Technology and for Chinese-English translation, in the form of a set of TED talks (some originally given in English, some in Chinese) that have been annotated with discourse relations in the style of the Penn Discourse TreeBank, adapted to properties of Chinese text that are not present in English. The resource is currently unique in annotating discourse-level properties of planned spoken monologues rather than of written text.
